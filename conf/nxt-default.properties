#### Blocks and transactions ####

# Delay generation of next block in order to accumulate more transactions in it.
# Waiting for much more than 15 s is not useful as transactions are allowed at
# most 15 s timestamp difference from the block they can be included in.
nxt.forgingDelay=20

# Generate and submit the next block before its hit time in response to
# receiving a lower difficulty block. Submitting the block more than 15 s before
# its time however will lead to its rejection.

# Enable re-broadcasting of new transactions until they are received back from

# disabled, to avoid the risk of revealing that this node is the submitter of
# such re-broadcasted new transactions.
nxt.enableTransactionRebroadcasting=true

# Do not allow the number of unconfirmed transactions in memory to exceed this
# value. If exceeded, the same transaction ordering as when choosing which

# startup.
nxt.defaultDesktopAccount=

#### MINT ####

# (default: localhost).
nxt.mint.serverAddress=

# When set to false the mint worker will resume operation even in case a mint
# transaction has returned an error response.

#### Shuffling ####

# Delete finished shufflings and their participants. When enabled, records of
# completed shufflings and their participants are deleted after the shuffling
# has finished, which will improve performance by keeping their tables smaller.
nxt.deleteFinishedShufflings=false

# Use strong secure random implementation. As this can block on unix systems,
# it is disabled by default. Enable only if using haveged or other entropy
# source that makes reading from /dev/random fast, otherwise server-side
# encryption will be unusably slow and cause coin shufflings to fail.
nxt.useStrongSecureRandom=false

# Maximum number of shufflers allowed to run at the same time on this node.
nxt.maxNumberOfShufflers=100



#### JETTY ####

# Settings for the Jetty Denial Of Service Filter, used for the peer networking
