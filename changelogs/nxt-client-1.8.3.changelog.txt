nxt-client-1.8.3:

API changes:

includeHoldingInfo parameter added to the GetAccountLedgerEntry and
GetAccountLedgerEntry APIs.


UI improvements:

Account switch no longer reloads the wallet.

Numeric decimal position, thousands separator and date formats are now locale 
based. The default browser locale language is used by default. A new 
"Regional Format" client side setting provides the ability to override the
default.

Numric formatting is now implemented for most table columns which display NXT
amounts or holding amounts. The number of decimals positions in each cell is
calculated according to the largest number of decimals required and zeros are
padded to the right.

Amounts specified in NXT are limited to the number of decimal positions
specified by the "Maximum NXT decimal positions" client setting. The default 
behavior is to display two digits after the decimal position.

For transaction tables, displayed in the dashboard and other pages. The amount 
and fee columns were merged into a single "Balance Change" column. Height column
was added as a link to the block in which the transaction is included. 

Starting the wallet on a specific asset page is now supported.


Desktop Wallet:

Right click functionality for copy/cut/paste of input fields and copy of label
text is now enabled. Right click menu on the asset exchange left pane is
enabled.

Setting admin password is no longer required when using the desktop wallet.
