This is an experimental release. It adds several new features, which however do
not require a hard fork.


JavaFX UI:

A desktop wallet UI, mostly equivalent to the in-browser UI, is launched on
supported platforms automatically when the server is started by clicking on
the Nxt desktop icon or start menu shortcut.

More details about the JavaFX UI are available at:
https://bitbucket.org/JeanLucPicard/nxt/issues/338/desktop-wallet

The property nxt.defaultDesktopAccount can be used to specify an account to
login to automatically once the desktop wallet loads.

The desktop wallet UI can be disabled by setting
nxt.launchDesktopApplication=false

The pre-compiled package will still run if JavaFX is not available, but to
recompile the code on such platforms the compile-nojfx.sh script must be used,
which skips the compilation of the desktop wallet.

The installer now creates a start and stop menu shortcuts and desktop icons on
Unix platforms too, which start the NRS client in desktop mode. From the
command line, use the new start.sh script to start the client in desktop mode,
and the corresponding stop.sh script to stop it. The start.sh and stop.sh
scripts can be run from any directory.

The jar installer package has been replaced with a self-extracting shell script
package nxt-client-1.8.0e.sh, which Unix users can just run, or click on, in
order to launch the installer. An advantage of using the installer instead of
the zip package is that the installer will create the above mentioned menu
shortcuts and desktop icons, and will also automatically remove old libraries
from previous installations in the same directory.

A known bug (of IzPack it seems) is that on Unix the installer fails to create
desktop icons when installing in a not yet existing target directory. It will
also fail to remove old menu shortcuts and desktop icons, so first running an
uninstall of a previous installation is still advisable.

Incompatible change:

Note that when run in desktop mode on Unix, the ~/.nxt directory is now used to
store configuration files, logs, and the nxt_db blockchain database. This makes
it simpler to upgrade to a new version, by deleting the content of the old nxt
installation directory, as no user configuration files or database files are
stored in it.

The run.sh script continues to use command line mode, i.e. does not attempt to
start the desktop wallet and desktop tray icon, and continues to use the nxt
installation directory from within which it must be run to store the nxt_db
database, logs, and configuration files. Users who want to use desktop mode but
still use the nxt installation directory instead of ~/.nxt for those files can
use the run-desktop.sh script instead.


Funding Monitor:

The new Funding Monitor feature provides monitoring account balances, and their
automated replenishment from a funding account, based on account properties set
by the funding account to the monitored accounts.

NXT, asset, or currency balances can be monitored. If a balance falls below
the configured threshold, a transaction will be submitted to transfer units
from the funding account to the monitored account. A transfer will remain
pending if the number of blocks since the previous transfer transaction is less
than the interval configured for the monitor.

The APIs for the Funding Monitor feature are StartFundingMonitor,
GetFundingMonitor, and StopFundingMonitor. Detailed documentation for those is
provided in the API javadoc files. A user interface for setting and viewing
currently running Funding Monitors is accessible from under the cogwheel menu.


Client UI page or modal redirection. By adding page or modal parameters to the
http://localhost:7876/index.html URL, the client can be redirected to open a
specific page or modal pop-up, with pre-populated parameter values.
For usage example, see:
https://bitbucket.org/JeanLucPicard/nxt/pull-requests/42/added-page-redirect-modal-popup-with

The Marketplace has been enhanced by adding recent listings and recent
purchases tables, showing the last 10 goods listed or purchased.

Marketplace listings now can have images. Image files are uploaded as prunable
unencrypted binary message attachments to the DGSListing transaction. A new
messageFile file parameter has been added to the dgsListing API, to allow
direct upload of files as multipart form data. This parameter is also supported
by all createTransaction APIs which allow message attachments, but is not
exposed on their /test API pages.

Image attachments that have been pruned are retrieved automatically from
archival nodes when the user views the page.

A new downloadPrunableMessage API has been added, to allow downloading of
prunable message attachments directly as binary data. An optional secretPhrase
parameter is supported, to allow decryption and downloading of the encrypted
part of the message instead of the plain text part.

The nxt.apiSSLCiphers property can be used to select which SSL ciphers should
be enabled for the API server when using SSL.

Unless overridden in nxt.myPlatform, the real system platform is now shown in
the peer info, as found in the java os.platform and os.arch system properties.

Other minor bugfixes and optimizations.

Updated jetty to version 9.3.8, lucene to 5.3.2, tika to 1.12, and slf4j to
1.7.18. Delete the old lib directory first when installing manually on top of a
previous installation. If using the installer, old libraries will be deleted
automatically, as well as any existing files under the classes and html
directories, excluding html/ui/plugins.


Server-side add-ons:

It is now possible to trigger script execution, or really add any custom Java
code to the server, by writing a class which implements the nxt.addons.AddOn
interface, making sure it is on the classpath, and enabling it by adding its
name to the nxt.addOns property. See the example add-ons in the nxt.addons
package. The AfterStart and BeforeShutdown add-ons can be used to trigger
scripts to be run just after the server has started, and just before shutdown.
Java source files for add-ons can be placed under addons/src to be compiled with
the compile.sh script, and the resulting class files under addons/classes will
be included on the classpath at runtime.

This is an unsupported feature for developers only. While in the 1.x series
the Java API is expected to be stable, it will undergo significant refactoring
in 2.0. Keep any custom add-on code simple, and be prepared to have to change it
for 2.0 or discard it. It should also be obvious that such custom Java code can
crash your node or have unexpected side effects.

Malicious add-ons installed under the classes directory can easily get access
to your secret phrase. For add-ons installed under addons/classes, this has been
made more difficult, but they could still do other malicious acts. Therefore,
do not install and run add-ons from untrusted sources.
